# Minetest ScrewDriver Plus 

An easier to use screwdriver for Minetest, and a spirit level.

## Flip and swivel

To use ScrewDriver+, left-click to set the axis direction, then swivel the node around that axis.

ScrewDriver+ flips the axis in an intuitive order, progressing through X pointing up, X pointing down, Y up, Y down, Z up and Z down.

## Messages

If you are feeling disoriented (!), you can issue a command

	/screwdriver messages on

Every time you use the screwdriver, a chat message will appear telling you the state of the rotation. Run `/screwdriver messages off` to stop this behaviour.

## Spirit Level

The sprit level allows you to either reset the orientation of the node to zero, or print the information for the node if messages are on.

## Todo

* ..... test. This is pre-alpha code !
* Add wear
* Add textures
* Make spirit level not depend on messages setting
