An easier to use screwdriver for Minetest, and a spirit level.

By default, screwdrivers and spirit levels can be made with steel, bronze, gold, diamond and mese, and improve in durability in turn.

You can opt so simply have just the steel screwdriver by setting the option `screwdriver.steel_only = true` in `minetest.conf`

This screwdriver flips the axis in an intuitive order, progressing through X pointing up, X pointing down, Y up, Y down, Z up and Z down.

The ScrewDrvier displays orientation information on-screen upon rotating.flipping an object.

## Spirit Level

The sprit level allows you to either reset the orientation of the node to zero using a left-click, or print the information for the node using a right-click.
